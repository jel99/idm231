## Pokémon to Use

### According to actual research

- Aries = Charmeleon (fire)
    - Like a Charmeleon, you are a confident person who won't stop until you've gotten what you want. One weakness of yours is that you're hot-headed and will scratch anyone who makes you mad with your razor-sharp claws.
- Taurus = Diglett (earth)
    - As a Diglett, you are reliable, practical, and responsible. You won't let another Diglett down, or let those pesky humans build a dam in your forest. However, being possisive is one of your weaknesses that you need to work on.
- Gemini = Pidgey (air)
    - Like a Pidgey, you are a gentle, affectionate person who doesn't like to get into fights if you don't have to. However, if danger approaches, you will kick up sand into your opponents face to get away. Being nervous like this is one of your weaknesses.
- Cancer = Lapras (water)
    - As a Lapras, you are a very loyal, emotional, and sympathetic person. You will ferry your friends safety if they need it. However, you can be moody (possibly since you have been hunted to near extinction), and also insecure.
- Leo = Arcanine (fire)
    - Like an Arcanine, you enjoy being admired for your beauty and magnificence. However, sometimes this admiration can make you a bit arrogant and self-centered. But you also are very warm-hearted, generous, and cheerful, always looking on the bright side of life. You can cheer your friends up easily when they're down.
- Virgo = Sandshrew (earth)
    - As a Sandshrew, you can adapt easily to whatever is thrown at you in life. You are very analytical in how you approach tasks, but can also be overly critical of yourself, possibly working too much and pushing people away because of it.
- Libra = Dodrio (air)
    - Like a Dodrio, you are very good at cooperating within your own mind, and can execute detailed plans easily. Because of this, you are very diplomatic as well. At some times, however, you can be indecisive as to what to do in some situations.
- Scorpio = Staryu (water)
    - As a Staryu, you are very resourceful and brave in a battle, being able to regenerate any part of yourself at will. However, not wanting anybody to figure out your one weak spot, you can be distrusting and secretive.
- Sagittarius = Rapidash (fire)
    - Like a Rapidash, you enjoy freedom, traveling fast, and being in the great outdoors. You really just love to run, and will chase after anything at top speed if you see that it's faster than you. However, because of being so speedy all the time, you can be really impatient when things get slow for you.
- Capricorn = Machoke (earth-ish)
    - As a Machoke, you are responsible and disciplined, always going to the gym on time. You also enjoy helping friends move and will carry all their stuff for them. However, due to your disciplined nature, you can be somewhat condescending at times to others.
- Aquarius = Dragonite (air)
    - Like a Dragonite, you are very progressive in your ideologies, and are extremely independent. You do like to spend time with friends a lot, but can be uncompromising and temperamental at times.
- Pisces = Goldeen (water)
    - As a Goldeen, you really enjoy a good swim in your local river. To your friends, you are known as the "Water Queen/King". You are also a very compassionate, gentle, and artistic person. However, you can sometimes be overly trusting of people, as well as too fearful of what lies ahead in the great river of life.
