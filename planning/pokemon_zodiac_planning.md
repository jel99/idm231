# Planning for Pokémon Zodiac

## Description

This website will have 12 Pokémon, one of which is assigned to someone based on their birthday. This could be any of the ones I listed below, in the Possible Pokémon section.

Users will be able to click on the images of Pokémon, which will surround the input form, and also be shown their descriptions and how they relate to their assigned Zodiac.

## Pokémon to Use

### According to actual research

- Aries = Charmeleon (fire)
    - Like a Charmeleon, you are a confident person who won't stop until you've gotten what you want. One weakness of yours is that you're hot-headed and will scratch anyone who makes you mad.
- Taurus = Diglett (earth)
    - As a Diglett, you are reliable, practical, and responsible. You won't let another Diglett down, or let those pesky humans build a dam in your forest.
- Gemini = Pidgey (air)
    - 
- Cancer = Lapras (water)
    - 
- Leo = Arcanine (fire)
    - 
- Virgo = Sandshrew (earth)
    - 
- Libra = Dodrio (air)
    - 
- Scorpio = Staryu (water)
    - 
- Sagittarius = Moltres (fire)
    - 
- Capricorn = Machoke (earth-ish)
    - 
- Aquarius = Dragonite (air)
    - 
- Pisces = Goldeen (water)
    -
